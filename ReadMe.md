PbniRegex - PbRegexCoach
------------------------

PbniRegex is a PBNI extension for Powerbuilder 9 to 12.6 that provides 
 - a uo_regex object wrapper to the PCRE regular expression engine
 - a FastReplaceAll() global function to perform string replacements
   implemented with C++ STL to save you from iterating with Pos() and
   Replace() PBscript functions
   
PbRegexCoach started as a basic test application for PbniRegex and grown 
to a full featured regex testing tool similar to the Regex Coach with 
a unit testing graphical interface.

There are some binaries available [here](http://sebastien.kirche.free.fr/powerbuilder/en.html#pbni).
